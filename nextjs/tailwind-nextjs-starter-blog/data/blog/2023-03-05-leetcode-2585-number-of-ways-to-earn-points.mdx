## 🗒️ Problems

[2585. Number of Ways to Earn Points - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-earn-points/)

```
There is a test that has n types of questions.
You are given an integer target and a 0-indexed 2D integer array types
where types[i] = [counti, marksi] indicates that
there are counti questions of the ith type, and each one of them is worth marksi points.

Return the number of ways you can earn exactly target points in the exam.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Note that questions of the same type are indistinguishable.

For example, if there are 3 questions of the same type,
then solving the 1st and 2nd questions is the same as solving the 1st and 3rd questions, or the 2nd and 3rd questions.
```

```
Input: target = 6, types = [[6,1],[3,2],[2,3]]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can earn 6 points in one of the seven ways:
- Solve 6 questions of the 0th type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
- Solve 4 questions of the 0th type and 1 question of the 1st type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6
- Solve 2 questions of the 0th type and 2 questions of the 1st type: 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6
- Solve 3 questions of the 0th type and 1 question of the 2nd type: 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6
- Solve 1 question of the 0th type, 1 question of the 1st type and 1 question of the 2nd type: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- Solve 3 questions of the 1st type: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
- Solve 2 questions of the 2nd type: 3 + 3 = 6
```

## 🤦‍♂️ First attempt

- I thought that this problem is similar to [01 knapsack](https://tkhwang.me/blog/2022-10-14-geeksforgeeks-01-knapsack) problem.

## 🥳⬇️ Think differently

- Can I think up a top-down solution ?

```javascript
dp(remain, index)
```

## 💡⬇️ basecase

- When `remain === 0`, we found one case.
- When `index` exceeds the given `types` length, we failed to find a solution.

```javascript
const dfs = (remain, index) => {
  if (remain === 0) return 1
  if (index >= N) return 0

  // main code
}
```

## ✨⬇️ top-down `dp()`

- For given `types[index]`, we can use `count (0 <= c <= count)` number of `marks`.
- If we can reduce `remain` by using `c * marks`, go move the next `types[index +1]` with reduced `remain`.

```javascript
const N = types.length
const MOD = 7 + 10 ** 9

const dfs = (remain, index) => {
  // basecase

  const [count, marks] = types[index]

  let total = 0
  for (let c = 0; c <= count; c += 1) {
    if (remain - c * marks >= 0) total += dfs(remain - c * marks, index + 1)
    else break
  }
  return total % MOD
}
```

## 🔥 My Solution

- Add memoization `cache`.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} target
 * @param {number[][]} types
 * @return {number}
 */
var waysToReachTarget = function (target, types) {
  const N = types.length
  const MOD = 7 + 10 ** 9

  const cache = {}
  const genKey = (remain, index) => `${remain}:${index}`

  const dfs = (remain, index) => {
    if (remain === 0) return 1
    if (index >= N) return 0
    if (cache[genKey(remain, index)] !== undefined) return cache[genKey(remain, index)]

    const [count, marks] = types[index]

    let total = 0
    for (let c = 0; c <= count; c += 1) {
      if (remain - c * marks >= 0) total += dfs(remain - c * marks, index + 1)
      else break
    }
    return (cache[genKey(remain, index)] = total % MOD)
  }

  return dfs(target, 0) % MOD
}
```

### 🙆‍♂️ Time complexity: `O(target * len(types) * max(count))`
