## üóíÔ∏è Problems

[2439. Minimize Maximum of Array - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-of-array/)

```
You are given a 0-indexed array nums comprising of n non-negative integers.
In one operation, you must:

Choose an integer i such that 1 <= i < n and nums[i] > 0.
* Decrease nums[i] by 1.
* Increase nums[i - 1] by 1.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer of nums
after performing any number of operations.
```

```
Input: nums = [3,7,1,6]
Output: 5
Explanation:
One set of optimal operations is as follows:
1. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [4,6,1,6].
2. Choose i = 3, and nums becomes [4,6,2,5].
3. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [5,5,2,5].
The maximum integer of nums is 5.
It can be shown that the maximum number cannot be less than 5.
Therefore, we return 5.
```

#### Constraints:

- n == nums.length
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## ü§î Understand problem

- I can do one operation
  - decrease current number by 1
  - increase previous number by 1
- What the minimum of the maximum of nums ?

## ü•≥ Think differently

- Move one from cur to previous.
- `nums[0]` is no way to decrease.
- Can I use [the generalized binary search algorithm to find the minimum](https://tkhwang.me/snippets/binary-search-in-javascript) ?
  - binary search for the maximum number
    - Is it possible to make the maximum value to be given number ?
    - Find the minimum of the maximum

## ‚ú®üìè [Basic template for finding the minimum](https://tkhwang.me/snippets/binary-search-in-javascript)

```
               left, right
                /\
                 |
```

```javascript
let left = MIN
let right = MAX

while (left <= right) {
  const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)

  if (isOK(mid)) {
    right = mid - 1
  } else {
    left = mid + 1
  }
}

return left
```

## üçÄüìè `isOK(max)` logic

Is is possible to make the maximum number to be given number `max` ?

- `nums[0]` can not be decreased. If `nums[0]` is greater than the given max, it will fail.
- Check from the end backwards to the beginning.
- If current number is smaller than the given max, it's OK.
- If current number is greater than the given max, it should be decreased to make the maximum number to be the given `max`.
  - Apply one operation.
  - decrease cur by diff (`max - cur`) and increase prv by diff.
- Finally check the most increased `nums[0]` is same or smaller than the given `max`.

```javascript
const isOK = (max) => {
  if (nums[0] > max) return false

  const nums = [..._nums]

  for (let i = N - 1; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
    let prv = nums[i - 1]
    let cur = nums[i]

    if (cur < max) continue

    const diff = cur - max
    nums[i - 1] += diff
    nums[i] -= diff
  }

  return nums[0] <= max
}
```

## üî•üìè My Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimizeArrayValue = function (_nums) {
  const N = _nums.length

  const isOK = (max) => {
    if (_nums[0] > max) return false

    const nums = [..._nums]

    for (let i = N - 1; i >= 1; i -= 1) {
      let prv = nums[i - 1]
      let cur = nums[i]

      if (cur < max) continue

      const diff = cur - max
      nums[i - 1] += diff
      nums[i] -= diff
    }

    return nums[0] <= max
  }

  let left = Math.min(..._nums)
  let right = 10 ** 9

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)

    if (isOK(mid)) {
      right = mid - 1
    } else {
      left = mid + 1
    }
  }
  return left
}
```
