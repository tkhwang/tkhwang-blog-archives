One of the famous dynamic programming problems.

## 🗒️ Problems

[322. Coin Change - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

```
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations
and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
```

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

## 🤔 Understand problem

- Given the amount of money, find a minimum number of coins to make up that amount.

## 🥳 Think differently

- Need to check all possible cases.
- Just use coins to make up that amount.

## ⬆️ bottom-up : `dp` array

- `dp[amount]` : the minimum number of coins with that amount of money

```javascript
const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity)
dp[0] = 0
```

#### 🥳⬆️ Think differently

- If you know `dp[i - coin]` (the minimum number of coins with `i-coin` amount)
- What is `dp[i]` ?
  - I used one more coin of the minimum coin usage of `i-coin` amount `dp[i-coin]`.
  - `dp[i] = dp[i-coin] + 1`
- `dp[i]` is the minimum number of all cases
  - `Math.min(dp[i], dp[i-coin] + 1)`

#### 🔥⬆️ My solution

```javascript
var coinChange = function (coins, amount) {
  const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity)
  dp[0] = 0

  for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i += 1) {
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (i - coin < 0) continue

      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coin])
    }
  }

  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount]
}
```

## ⬇️ top-down : `dp()`

#### 🥳⬇️ Think differently

- `dp(money)` : the minimum number of coins to make up `money`.
  - When not possible, return `-1`.
  - When possible, it should use one more coin of the previous result: `dp(money-coin)` + 1.

#### ⬇️ top-down without memoization

```javascript
var coinChange = function (coins, amount) {
  const dp = (remain) => {
    if (remain < 0) return -1
    if (remain === 0) return 0

    let min = Infinity
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (remain - coin < 0) continue

      const res = dp(remain - coin)
      if (res === -1) continue
      min = Math.min(min, 1 + res)
    }
    return min === Infinity ? -1 : min
  }

  return dp(amount)
}
```

#### 🔥⬇️ top-down: My Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} coins
 * @param {number} amount
 * @return {number}
 */
var coinChange = function (coins, amount) {
  const cache = {}

  const dp = (remain) => {
    if (remain < 0) return -1
    if (remain === 0) return 0
    if (cache[remain] !== undefined) return cache[remain]

    let min = Infinity
    for (const coin of coins) {
      if (remain - coin < 0) continue

      const res = dp(remain - coin)
      if (res === -1) continue
      min = Math.min(min, 1 + res)
    }
    return (cache[remain] = min === Infinity ? -1 : min)
  }

  return dp(amount)
}
```
