## üóíÔ∏è Problems

[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

```
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day
to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future
to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
```

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and
sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed
because you must buy before you sell.
```

#### Constraints:

```
1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
```

## ü§î First attempt

- Buy in `i` day, and then sell in `j` day.

```javascript
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  const N = prices.length
  let max = -Infinity

  for (let i = 0; i < N; i += 1) {
    const buy = prices[i]
    for (let j = i + 1; j < N; j += 1) {
      const sell = prices[j]
      if (buy > sell) continue
      if (max < sell - buy) max = sell - buy
    }
  }
  return max === -Infinity ? 0 : max
}
```

### üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Failed time complexity : `O(n^2)`

- Input size is `10^5`, so that the nested loop will cause TLE.

## ‚ú® Idea

- When does the maximum profit occur ?
  - Buy the lowest price.
  - Sell the highest price.
- Can you do this in `O(n)` ?

## üçÄ Update min price

```javascript
    let minPrice = Infinity;

    for (const price of prices) {
        if (minPrice > price) {
            minPrice = price
        } else {
          ...
        }
    }
```

## üçÄ Update max profit

- I can't sell in the same day which I bought.
- If it's NOT a min price, update the profit.

```javascript
  let maxProfit = -Infinity

  for (const price of prices) {
    if (minPrice > price) {
      ...
    } else {
      const profit = price - minPrice
      if (maxProfit < profit) maxProfit = profit
    }
  }
```

## üî• My Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let minPrice = Infinity
  let maxProfit = -Infinity

  for (const price of prices) {
    if (minPrice > price) {
      minPrice = price
    } else {
      const profit = price - minPrice
      if (maxProfit < profit) maxProfit = profit
    }
  }

  return maxProfit === -Infinity ? 0 : maxProfit
}
```
