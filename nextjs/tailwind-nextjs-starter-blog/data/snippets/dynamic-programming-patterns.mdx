This template is based on the article [Dynamic Programming Patterns](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/458695/Dynamic-Programming-Patterns#DP-on-Strings) in leetcode discuss and I changed for myself a little bit.

- Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target
- Distinct Ways
- Merging Intervals
- DP on Strings
- Decision Making

## üî• 1. Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target

#### 1.1 Statement

Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost / path / sum to reach the target.

#### 1.2 Approach

Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.

```javascript
routes[i] = min(routes[i-1], routes[i-2], ... , routes[i-k]) + cost[i]
```

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Top-Down

```javascript
for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
    result = min(result, topDown(target - ways[j]) + cost/ path / sum);
}
return memo[/*state parameters*/] = result;
```

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bottom-Up

```javascript
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {
           dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - ways[j]] + cost / path / sum) ;
       }
   }
}

return dp[target]
```

Generate optimal solutions for all values in the target and return the value for the target.

#### üóíÔ∏è 1.3. Typical problems

- [64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)
- [322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

## üî• 2. Distinct Ways

#### 2.1 Statement

```
Given a target find a number of distinct ways to reach the target.
```

#### 2.2 Approach

Sum all possible ways to reach the current state.

```javascript
routes[i] = routes[i-1] + routes[i-2], ... , + routes[i-k]
```

Generate sum for all values in the target and return the value for the target.

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Top-Down

```javascript
for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
    result += topDown(target - ways[j]);
}
return memo[/*state parameters*/] = result;
```

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Bottom-Up

```javascript
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i) {
   for (int j = 0; j < ways.size(); ++j) {
       if (ways[j] <= i) {
           dp[i] += dp[i - ways[j]];
       }
   }
}

return dp[target]
```

#### üóíÔ∏è 2.3. Typical problems

- [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
- [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

## üî• 3. Merging Intervals

#### 3.1 Statement

```
Given a set of numbers find an optimal solution for a problem
considering the current number and the best you can get from the left and right sides.
```

#### 3.2 Approach

Find all optimal solutions for every interval and return the best possible answer.

```javascript
// from i to j
dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] + result[k] + dp[k + 1][j]
```

Get the best from the left and right sides and add a solution for the current position.

#### üóíÔ∏è 3.3. Typical problems

- [96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)
- [1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/)

## üî• 4. DP on Strings

General problem statement for this pattern can vary but most of the time you are given two strings where lengths of those strings are not big

#### 4.1 Statement

```
Given two strings s1 and s2, return some result.
```

#### 4.2 Approach

Most of the problems on this pattern requires a solution that can be accepted in `O(n^2)` complexity.

#### 4.2.1 two string `s1` and `s2` given

- `dp[i][j]` = result with `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]`.

```javascript
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
       if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]) {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       } else {
           dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
       }
   }
}
```

#### 4.2.2 one string `s1` given

- `dp[i][j]` = result with `s1[0:i]` and `s1[0:j]`

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i < N; i += 1) {
    for (let j = i; j < N; j += 1) {
        if (s[i] === s[j]) {
            dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
        }
    }
}
```

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i < N; i += 1) {
    for (let delta = 0; delta < N - l; delta += 1) {
        let j = i + delta;

        if (s[i] === s[j]) {
            dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = /*code*/;
        }
    }
}
```

## üî• 5. Decision Making

The general problem statement for this pattern is forgiven situation decide whether to use or not to use the current state. So, the problem requires you to make a decision at a current state.

#### 5.1 (Decision Making) Statement

```
Given a set of values find an answer with an option to choose or ignore the current value.
```

#### 5.2 (Decision Making) Approach

If you decide to choose the current value use the previous result where the value was ignored; vice-versa, if you decide to ignore the current value use previous result where value was used.

```javascript
// i - indexing a set of values
// j - options to ignore j values
for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
   for (int j = 1; j <= k; ++j) {
       dp[i][j] = max({dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + arr[i], dp[i-1][j-1]});
       dp[i][j-1] = max({dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + arr[i], arr[i]});
   }
}
```
