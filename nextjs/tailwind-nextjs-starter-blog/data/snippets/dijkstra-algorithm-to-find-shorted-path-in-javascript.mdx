## 💡 Notes

- can be used only positive weight graph.
- kind of Greedy algorithm
- `best-first search` : shortest path first search

## ✨ Algorithm

- From the start node, do the edge relaxation of the next nodes and update the shorted path to that node.
- Select and move to the shorted node among the newly relaxated nodes.
- Repeat this.

### Common

```javascript
// adjcent list : graph

// All nodes are set to Infinity
const costs = Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity)
// except starting point
costs[k] = 0
```

### using nested-for statement : `O(V^2)`

### 🔥 using min-heap : `O(ElogV)`

```javascript
// [ node, cost ]
const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({ compare: (a, b) => a[1] - b[1] })
minHeap.enqueue([k, 0])

while (minHeap.size()) {
  const [cur, cost] = minHeap.dequeue()

  // validation (for easy usage of heap)
  // - matched: latest smallest one
  // - not matched: old one which is reduced to smaller one due to the relaxation
  if (costs[cur] !== cost) continue

  if (graph[cur] === undefined) continue
  for (const [next, nextCost] of graph[cur]) {
    // relaxation
    if (costs[next] > costs[cur] + nextCost) {
      costs[next] = costs[cur] + nextCost
      minHeap.enqueue([next, costs[next]])
    }
  }
}
```
