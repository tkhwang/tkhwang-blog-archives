## 🍀 General guideline

There are 4 general rules for solving a pattern-based question :

- We always use nested loops for printing the patterns.
  - For the `outer loop`, we `count the number of lines/rows` and loop for them.
  * Next, for the `inner loop`, we focus on `the number of columns` and somehow connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get the required number of columns to be printed.
- We print the numbers inside the `inner loop`.
- `Observe symmetry` in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination of two or more similar patterns or not.
