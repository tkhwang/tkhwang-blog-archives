## ✨ Background

```
[0,                     ...                  , N-1]
      [ left,           ... , right ]
      => shrink window               => expand window
         if condition is NOT OK
```

- The idea behind the sliding window technique is to efficiently find the "best" window that fits some constraint.
- Usually used for solving subarray (continuous array) problems.
- Efficiently find the "best" window that fits some constraint.

## 🔥 Algorithm

- When `right` moves, which data should be updated ?
- When should the `window` be shrinked ?
- When `left` moves, which data should be updated ?
- Where should we update the `result` : expanding or shrinking ?

```javascript
const needs = {}
const window = {}

let left = 0
for (let right = 0; right < N; right += 1) {
  // update window information

  while (WINDOW_CONDITION_BROKEN) {
    // remove/reduce arr[left] information in window
    left += 1
  }

  // check whether window meets needs condition
}
```
