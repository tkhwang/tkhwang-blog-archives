## ðŸ”¥ GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) : `O(log(num1 + num2))`

- The GCD of `num1` and `num2` is the GCD of `num2` and `num1 % num2`.

```javascript
const getGCD = (num1, num2) => (num2 > 0 ? getGCD(num2, num1 % num2) : num1)
```

```javascript
const getGCD = (num1, num2) => {
  while (num2 > 0) {
    let r = num1 % num2
    num1 = num2
    num2 = r
  }

  return num1
}
```

## ðŸ”¥ LCM (Least Common Multiple)

- First divide by gcd to prevent the overflow of the product of two numbers.

```javascript
const getLCM = (num1, num2) => (num1 / getGCD(num1, num2)) * num2
```
