## ‚ú® Algorithm

```
Add the minimum cost edge if it won't cause a cycle until connecting n-1 edges.
```

- For `n` nodes, `n-1` edges is required for constructing minimum spanning tree.
- For detecting cycle, [union-find](https://tkhwang.me/snippets/union-find-in-javascript) algorithm is used.

```javascript
var minimumCost = function (n, connections) {
  // sort cost ascendingly.
  // [ begin, end, cost]
  connections.sort((a, b) => a[2] - b[2])

  const uf = new UnionFind(n)
  let res = 0

  for (const [u, v, cost] of connections) {
    // if u and v are not connected (don't have a cycle)
    if (uf.find(u) !== uf.find(v)) {
      res += cost
      // connect and make it one.
      uf.union(u, v)
    }
  }

  // if all nodes are connected (only one component is there), return the cost.
  return uf.getComponents() === 1 ? res : -1
}
```
