It shows how to use binary search in more generalized ways to find the minimum value in javascript.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 0. Requirements

- The condition should show the monotonicity.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è (MIN) 1. Find minimum Algorithm

```
    [left, ...                                    right)
                -------------------------------------
                |
                |<--- isOK(position) === true --->
      -----------
 ...  left - 1, [left, right]
```

- We will find the minimum `left` which meets the condition `isOK(position)` by binary search.
- `left` is the minimum which meets the condition `isOK(position)`.
- The answer will be `left`.

```javascript
const bisectGeneralMin = (array) => {
  let left = MIN_SEARCH_SPACE
  let right = MAX_SEARCH_SPACE + 1

  const isOK = (value) => {
    // decision logic
    return true
  }

  while (left < right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)

    if (isOK(mid)) {
      // Because mid is checked to be OK, now mid should be the upper bound. [..., mid]
      right = mid
    } else {
      // Now mid is not OK, so that we need to check from [mid + 1, ...].
      left = mid + 1
    }
  }

  // After exiting the while loop,
  // left is the minimal k‚Äã satisfying the condition function;
  return left
}
```

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (MAX) 1. Find maximum Algorithm

```
    [left, ...                                    right)
                -------------------------------------
                |
                |<--- isFail(position) === true --->
      -----------
                [left, right]

       left - 1]
```

- We will find the minimum `left` which meets the condition `isFail(position)` by binary search.
- `left` is the minimum which meets the condition `isFail(position)`.
- Therefore the original answer which meet the condition is `left - 1`.

#### üî• Note

- The reason why `isFail(position)` is used for finding the maximum is for using the same binary search algorithm as for finding the mininum value.
- The only difference is the final answer `left` for minimum and `left -1` for maximum.

```javascript
const bisectGeneralMax = (array) => {
  let left = MIN_SEARCH_SPACE
  let right = MAX_SEARCH_SPACE + 1

  const isFail = (value) => {
    // decision logic
    return true
  }

  while (left < right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)

    if (isFail(mid)) {
      // Because mid is checked to be OK, now mid should be the upper bound. [..., mid]
      right = mid
    } else {
      // Now mid is not OK, so that we need to check from [mid + 1, ...].
      left = mid + 1
    }
  }

  // After exiting the while loop,
  // left is the minimal k‚Äã satisfying the condition isFail() function.
  // Therefore the final answer is left - 1, which is the maximum that meets the original condition.
  return left - 1
}
```
