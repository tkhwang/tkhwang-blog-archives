## ✨ Algorithm

- Build adjacent lists `graph` and dependency `indegrees`.
- Find zero dependency node which has `indegrees[node] === 0` and push it to `queue` for BFS.
- BFS traversal from zero dependency node.
- Store current node `cur` to the final result `orders[]`.
- Whenever traversing the next node `next`, decrease the dependency by one `indegrees[next] - 1`.
  - If its dependency becomes zero, push it to the queue and visit next.

## 🔥 Topological Sort

```javascript
const topologicalSort = (N, prerequisites) => {
  const graph = {}
  const indegrees = Array(N).fill(0)

  for (const [course, precourse] of prerequisites) {
    if (graph[precourse] === undefined) graph[precourse] = []
    graph[precourse].push(course)
    indegrees[course] += 1
  }

  const queue = []
  const orders = []

  // find zero dependency
  for (let i = 0; i < N; i += 1) {
    if (indegrees[i] === 0) queue.push(i)
  }

  // bfs
  while (queue.length) {
    const len = queue.length

    for (let i = 0; i < len; i += 1) {
      const cur = queue.shift()

      orders.push(cur)

      if (graph[cur] === undefined) continue
      for (const next of graph[cur]) {
        indegrees[next] -= 1
        if (indegrees[next] === 0) queue.push(next)
      }
    }
  }

  return orders
}
```
