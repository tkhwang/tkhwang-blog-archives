## ✨ Nested for statement : `O(n^2)` time complexity

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < N;; i += 1) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < N; j += 1) {
        // do something
    }
}
```

## ✨ For statement for fixed and relatively small number

- It doesn't depend on the input data size.
- If its size is relatively small and its value is fixed, the overall time complexity is much faster than that.

### 🍀 for alphabets (26) :

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 26; i += 1) {
  for (let j = i + 1; j < 26; j += 1) {
    ///
  }
}
```

### 🍀 for data ranges (50) :

```javascript
for (let i = -50; i < 0; i += 1) {
  //
}
```
